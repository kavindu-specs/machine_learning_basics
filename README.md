# 🤖 Machine Learning Basics

A foundational Python-based project designed to explore and implement **core machine learning concepts** from scratch and using popular libraries. This project is aimed at helping learners understand the step-by-step mechanics behind algorithms, model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing using real-world datasets from platforms like **Kaggle**.

## 🚀 Features

• ✅ Implementation of ML algorithms with and without libraries  
• ✅ Use of real-world datasets from online sources such as Kaggle  
• ✅ Focused on math-under-the-hood understanding and code clarity  
• ✅ Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
• ✅ Evaluation metrics and visualization  
• ✅ Organized, beginner-friendly codebase with comments
